Bitcore
=======

A pure, powerful core for your bitcoin project.

Bitcore is a complete, native interface to the Bitcoin network, and provides the core functionality needed to develop apps for bitcoin.

#Install

Bitcore runs on [node](http://nodejs.org/), and can be installed via [npm](https://npmjs.org/):
```
npm install bitcore
```

#Principles
Bitcoin is a powerful new peer-to-peer platform for the next generation of financial technology. The decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network allows for highly resilient bitcoin infrastructure, but the developer community needs reliable, open-source tools to implement bitcoin apps and services.

**Bitcore unchains developers from fallible, centralized APIs, and provides the tools to interact with the real Bitcoin network.**
